Simple, small, and lightweight WordPress plugin that allows you to enter custom functions just like you would use functions.php in a theme. This solves the issue of not having a functions.php file for some page builders. There is no admin interface, so adding custom functions works just like adding them to functions.php via a code editor. 
To use, download and install zip folder to wordpress using the plugins upload function. Activate plugin. Use the plugin file editor to add custom functions or use FTP or SFTP to add functions.
